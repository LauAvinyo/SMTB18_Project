# Comparative and Functional Genomics final project

The idea of this project is to understand how to annotate proteins of a newly sequenced genome.
Moreover we can see understand more about the proteins if generate the trees of each of the proteins.


The workflow of this project is the following:
1. For each of the proteins do BLAST, InterPro, KEGGBlast
2. Annotate as good as we can the function of each of the proteins
3. Blast againts local database
4. Filter the best 20 hits and do a tree with it
5. Understand each tree
